# My Resume

This is the latex source code of my resume. Based on the lovely [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) template.

## Building

Building is done with `make` and `xelatex`. Either [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or [MacTex](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) (depending on your platform) needs to be installed before trying to build.
