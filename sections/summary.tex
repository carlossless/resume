\begin{cvparagraph}
I have 7+ years experience in programming and software development focusing the majority of my time on iOS and Web development. I've solved software engineering problems in a wide range of industries from video games to industrial manufacturing.

When developing applications I strive to achieve two things: great user experience and a clean, clear and maintainable structure "under the hood".

An all-round technology lover, I am most intrigued by high level concepts and disciplines like computer language design, functional programming, but also low level performance and hardware design.
