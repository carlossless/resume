\begin{cvparagraph}
I enjoy solving problems by building software solutions and I have been doing that professionally for over \yearsofexperience{2009}{07}{01}.

When building products, I strive to make them responsive, reliable, and intuitive to use. Leveraging new technology for that purpose is something that excites me.

I am an all-around professional with a significant amount of programming experience and a moderate amount of people-management experience.
